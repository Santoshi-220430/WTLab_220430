                <h1>Music Therapy</h1>
                <p>Music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals 
                    within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an 
                    approved music therapy program. Music therapy is used to address physical,
                     emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. After assessing the
                      strengths and needs of each client, the qualified music therapist provi
                     des the indicated treatment including creating, singing, moving to, and/
                     or listening to music. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, 
                     clients' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas of their 
                     lives. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful for 
                     clients who find it difficult to express themselves in words. </p>
